### Working with your Jenkinsfile

The following sections provide details about handling:

specific Pipeline syntax in your Jenkinsfile and

features and functionality of Pipeline syntax which are essential in building your application or Pipeline project.

### Using environment variables

Jenkins Pipeline exposes environment variables via the global variable env, which is available from anywhere within a Jenkinsfile. The full list of environment variables accessible from within Jenkins Pipeline is documented at ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/pipeline-syntax/globals#env and includes:

BUILD_ID
The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created in Jenkins versions 1.597+

BUILD_NUMBER
The current build number, such as "153"

BUILD_TAG
String of jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}. Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification

BUILD_URL
The URL where the results of this build can be found (for example http://buildserver/jenkins/job/MyJobName/17/ )

EXECUTOR_NUMBER
The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) performing this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1

JAVA_HOME
If your job is configured to use a specific JDK, this variable is set to the JAVA_HOME of the specified JDK. When this variable is set, PATH is also updated to include the bin subdirectory of JAVA_HOME

JENKINS_URL
Full URL of Jenkins, such as https://example.com:port/jenkins/ (NOTE: only available if Jenkins URL set in "System Configuration")

JOB_NAME
Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".

NODE_NAME
The name of the node the current build is running on. Set to 'master' for the Jenkins controller.

WORKSPACE
The absolute path of the workspace

Referencing or using these environment variables can be accomplished like accessing any key in a Groovy Map, for example:

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo "Running ${env.BUILD_ID} on ${env.JENKINS_URL}"
            }
        }
    }
}
